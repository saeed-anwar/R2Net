## Introduction
Deep convolutional neural networks perform better on images containing spatially invariant degradations, also known as synthetic degradations; however, their performance is limited on real-degraded photographs and requires multiple-stage network modeling. To advance the practicability of restoration algorithms, this paper proposes a novel single-stage blind real image restoration network (R<sup>2</sup>Net) by employing a modular architecture. We use a residual on the residual structure to ease low-frequency information flow and apply feature attention to exploit the channel dependencies. Furthermore, the evaluation in terms of quantitative metrics and visual quality for four restoration tasks, i.e., Denoising, Super-resolution, Raindrop Removal, and JPEG Compression on  11 real degraded datasets against more than 30 state-of-the-art algorithms demonstrate the superiority of our R<sup>2</sup>Net. We also present the comparison on three synthetically generated degraded datasets for denoising to showcase our method's capability on synthetics denoising. 


## Requirements
- The model is built in PyTorch 0.4.0, PyTorch 0.4.1 
- Tested on Ubuntu 14.04/16.04 environment 
- python 3.6
- CUDA 9.0 
- cuDNN 5.1 
- pytorch=0.4.1
- torchvision=0.2.1
- imageio
- pillow

## Super-resolution
The proposed network produces remarkably higher numerical accuracy and better visual image quality than the classical state-of-the-art and CNN algorithms when being evaluated on the three conventional benchmark and three real-world datasets

Denoising results: In the first row, an image is corrupted by the Gaussian noise with Ïƒ = 50 from the BSD68 dataset. In the second row, a sample image from the RNI15 real noisy dataset. Our results have the best PSNR score for synthetic images, and unlike other methods, it does not have over-smoothing or over-contrasting artifacts. 


### Test
1. Download the trained models and code of our paper from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DV9-OgvYoR4ELQZY-R7vZiX5nTf-NZtX/view?usp=sharing). The total size for all models is **3.1MB.**

2. cd to '/IERDTestCode/code', run the following scripts and find the results in directory **IERD_Results**.

    **You can use the following script to test the algorithm. The first script is without self-ensembler and the second one is with self-ensemble.**

``` #Normal
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --data_test MyImage --noise_g 1 --model IERD --n_feats 64 --pre_train ../trained_model/IERD.pt --test_only --save_results --save 'SSID_Results' --testpath ../noisy --testset SIDD
```

``` #Ensemble
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python main.py --data_test MyImage --noise_g 1 --model IERD --n_feats 64 --pre_train ../trained_model/IERD.pt --test_only --save_results --save 'SSIDPlus_Results' --testpath ../noisy --testset SIDD --self_ensemble
```


### Results
**All the results for IERD can be downloaded from GoogleDrive from**  [SSID](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1em70fbrVCggxdv1vi0dLqriAR_f2lPjc/view?usp=sharing) (118MB), [RNI15](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NUmFpS7Zl4f70OZJVd96t35wSGSyvfMS/view?usp=sharing) (9MB) and [DnD](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IfTi6ZImNsrzqC6oFhgFF8Z9QKvZeAfE/view?usp=sharing) (2.3GB). 

### DnD Results

Comparison of our method against the state-of-the-art algorithms on real images containing Gaussian noise from Darmstadt Noise Dataset (DND) benchmark for different denoising algorithms. Difference can be better viewed in magnified view.
